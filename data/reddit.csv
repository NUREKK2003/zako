1;https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ilfd5x/reminder_any_use_of_chatgpt_or_ai_tools_will/;Reminder: any use of ChatGPT or AI tools will result in a ban;"Mods are seeing a noticeable increase in users using ChatGPT and similar tools not only to create posts but also to post *entire* responses in comments, disguised as genuine personal advice.

The sub is one of the biggest on Reddit and as a community it's so important - particularly for a topic like travel which is rooted in authentic human experiences - that all responses come in the form of genuine opinions and guidance. There's absolutely no point in us all being on here otherwise.

Mods have tools to identify these sort of posts, but it's worth reiterating moving into 2025 and with increased AI available in our day-to-day lives that any usage of this sort to make your posts or comments will result in an instant ban. The rules are stated very clearly in the sidebar and are not new.

None of us joined this community to read regurgitated information from a machine learning model like ChatGPT. AI tools can have their place for travellers sometimes, but outside of the occasional spellcheck or minor translation it should never be the main foundational element for any of your posts on this sub.

We want responses to be *your* opinions and knowledge. If you're asking a question, we want it to be in *your* voice.

If you suspect any usage we haven't spotted, report it - we are a group of volunteers on a huge sub and things often slip through the net.

I'm sure all users are on the same page here in terms of not letting AI generated content take over here, so it requires us all to work together. Thanks!";1739109790.0

It was a bodycam style footage but it seemed cramped, very busy and involved a lot of climbing. The video didnt give any context to where it was shot and how big the pyramid was. I once read somewhere that inside pyramids the climate is also very unpleasant (humid, smelly). Is this true? Is going inside a pyramid really a special experience or is it something i can live without?

  
Edit: I wonder why this gets downvoted. ";1740050908.0

I’m alone in Prague, I have injured my right knee in the middle of my trip and I need to go back home, to Brazil, as soon as possible.

I’ve changed my tickets to leave from Prague to Paris then to Brazil. But when I arrived today, the people at the airport told me it was not possible to board because I needed to have an extended leg rest request, in which they would remove the seat in front of me so I could have more space to rest my leg.

I’m immobilised and I can’t bend my right leg. When I talked to AirFrance Brazil or France, they just give me different informations about this. Tell me that I need to get a better seat with more space and that’s it.

The lady at the airport helped me get the leg rest request but she insisted so much that I couldn’t board without, that the crew of the airplane could not accept me there and stuff.

My question is, why would the AirFrance give me seats with more space instead of the “extended leg rest” if the crew would not accept it? Seems like most of the people I call in AirFrance don’t even know what that is. Is that a real thing? What should I do to get boarded.

I have another flight from Prague to Paris next Friday and I really don't want this people to stop me from boarding because of this.";1739997876.0

I'm just wondering if the stories of locals literally aggressing tourists in restaurants with water pistols and the like are exaggerated. 

Like I'd love to visit but at the same time i want to have a good time and if the locals are that sick of tourists i can just go elsewhere.

So I'm wondering if anyone here has recent experience to share about Barcelona?

We're just scouting ideas and we're prioritizing travel destinations that are off the beaten track so to speak.

We're both from and live in Europe so have already travelled around the continent pretty extensively, so we're looking further afield.

  
We were thinking southern India/Sri Lanka or a country or two in northern South America. 

It seems like May in India might not be great with the hot weather and close to Monsoon season?

Would May in South America be nice?

Any other 4 week suggestions around the world?";1740043859.0
